# ProjectMinerva
Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning framework in Kotlin/Java 8+

Goals:
- Multi-Objective
- Deep Learning
- Multi-Agent (Game theory)
- Distributed, at least at the agent level
- Easy to configure policies, exploration methods, and learning model.
- Toolbox for configurations, i.e. double Q-Learning, deep Q-learning, experience replays, etc.
